## Reporting issues

Issues are reported at the [packages issue tracker at Github](https://github.com/edutap-eu/edutap.wallet_google/issues).

Please search for existing issues on GitHub before reporting new ones.
This approach minimizes duplicates, streamlines issue management, and saves time for both reporters and maintainers.

Use the issue template addressing your problem.

## Pull Requests

First check if someone else already created a pull request solving your problem.
If so, get in contact with the author(s) and coordinate with them.

If you're the first, fork the repository and work on the code.
We recommend to create a branch in the fork too in order to make it easier to update the base branch.

Create a draft pull request after the first commit and mark it as draft.
This way you communicate your work to other developers, reducing the risk of duplicate work,

While working on the pull request ensure to run tests and linter before each commit and push.

If work is ready, remove the draft status from the PR to signalize readiness for review.

On of the core contributors will review, comment and - if all is fine - merge it.

## Documentation

We love improvements to the documentation.

We try to follow the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach as best as we can.

The documentation for this package is written to be rendered with Sphinx and MyST (a Markdown dialect).
The actual documentation is located at our [documentation](https://github.com/edutap-eu/documentation/) repository.
This package is there included as Git submodule.
However, do not edit in a clone of the documentation repository, but here.

Follow the pull request path also for documentation changes.
