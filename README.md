This package provides a Python API to interact with the Google Wallet Restful API to issue and manage digital passes.

It contains:

- an API to create, read, update, list and send messages to Google Wallet classes and objects;
- FastAPI endpoints to receive Google Wallet callback requests and to deliver pass images.

This is supported by
- Pydantic models of the classes, objects, and their data-types according to the Google Wallet documentation;
- an extensible registry for models of these classes and objects;
- a session manager for authorized HTTPS communication with the Google Restful API;
- a plugin system with protocols to decouple the actual business logic for the callback/ image provider.
